Some example files I've been developing to become more familiar in programming multiple GPUs. 
Happy GPU programming! ;D

Added tutorial files from: 

1. Sanders, Jason, and Edward Kandrot. CUDA by Example: An Introduction to General-Purpose GPU Programming, Portable Documents. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010.
2. Wesley Kenday, et al. MPI tutorial. Accessible from [here](https://github.com/wesleykendall/mpitutorial).
3. M.R. Smith. High Speed Heterogenous Computing Laboratory (HSHCL)'s tutorials. Accessible from [here](http://hshclncku.com/tutorials.html). (but careful some of this examples get no speed up)
